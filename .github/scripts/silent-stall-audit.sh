# silent-stall-audit.sh - Static regression checks for the issue #122 silent-stall
# hardening invariants (S1/S2/L1/L2), the R6 model free-tier guard, the R7
# review-restore ownership guard (PR #412 head rewind), the R8 vendored
# hardened runner guard, and the R9 schedule/dispatch retry-parity guard
# (issue #422).
# Wired into auditor.yml as the R1-R9 matrix.
#
# Usage: silent-stall-audit.sh <path-to-opencode.yml> [health-issue-number]
# R1-R6 are scoped to <path-to-opencode.yml>; R7-R9 audit the whole tree
# (the review-restore guard, the vendored runner, and every schedule/dispatch
# agent arm), so they trip on a bad curator.yml/auditor.yml/ideate.yml/lab.yml
# no matter which file the audit was pointed at.
# Exit code is always 0 so it never breaks the auditor run; failures are reported
# on stdout and (when a health issue number is supplied and GITHUB_TOKEN is set)
# posted as a comment to the lab-health board.

# [R7] Review-restore ownership gate (PR #412 head-rewind regression): the
# opencode-review restore step may only undo a head movement made from its own
# workspace, and must push with a lease. The pre-fix version force-pushed the
# snapshot captured at run START, so any push that landed while a review was
# still running (Fixer, Builder, owner) was silently reverted when the run
# ended - that is exactly how PR #412 lost 13 Fixer commits.
# The gate needs FIVE properties: a local-ref ownership test, a lease, the
# pre-push marker, a marker that records the PUSHED COMMIT (marker_sha) which
# must equal the live head, and an unbroken push chain (chain_ok) proving no
# external commit sits between the checked-out head and the live head - an
# existence-only marker or a marker without the chain survives a later
# external push and still rewinds it (Y2/Z2). A bare force push is banned
# outright.
# The marker closes the proxy hole: a local ref alone is advanced by a plain
# `git pull --ff-only` / `git reset --hard origin/<b>` that never pushed, so
# ref movement by itself still rewinds external work.
