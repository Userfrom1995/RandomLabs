# Pac-Man Terminal Arcade

A complete, polished Pac-Man arcade experience that runs directly in the terminal. Modern terminals (Kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm, Konsole) get sprite-grade visuals through the Kitty graphics protocol, Windows Terminal is covered via Sixel, and a half-block Unicode plus truecolor fallback guarantees the game plays everywhere, including headless CI and legacy consoles.

Clean-room rule: all code, art, audio, mazes, and tuning tables are originals written for this project. No ROMs, no ripped sprites, no copied sources.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11 or newer. No install step; the guaranteed play path uses only the standard library. (`pip install Pillow` unlocks the optional image backends.)

```sh
python3 pacman/pacman.py --maze-check
python3 pacman/pacman.py --self-check --ticks 2400 --seed 2
python3 pacman/pacman.py --render-check --renderer kitty
python3 pacman/pacman.py --render-bench --frames 60
```

## What works today

- Deterministic headless engine: original 28x31 symmetric maze with tunnel and ghost house, 282 dots plus 4 energizers (every pickup flood-fill verified reachable), tile-center movement with buffered turns and cornering assist, scoring with ghost-chain bonuses and extra life, lives with death and respawn sequences, endless level progression with a speed ramp.
- Four ghost personalities with distinct chase styles (direct pursuit, ahead-ambush, pincer-mirror, shy retreat), alternating scatter/chase waves with about-face reversals, power-pellet fright with flashing warning and 200-400-800-1600 chains, eye returns that revive at the house door, dot-counter plus idle-timeout house exits, tunnel slowdown, and a late-level leader enrage that pins chase.
- Seeded simulation with split RNG streams and replay hashes: identical inputs reproduce bit-identical state on any machine.
- Tiered renderer: one scene painter feeds every backend, so maze, entity, and HUD positions match within one cell everywhere. The Kitty backend transmits a cached original sprite atlas once and places per frame with cursor-anchored text fallback; the Sixel backend rasterizes dirty regions with a bounded palette and caps itself at 10 fps; the Unicode reference backend emits only changed cells inside synchronized output. A watchdog steps down one tier on backend errors or repeated slow frames and never raises out of `present`.
- Test suite: 135 pytest cases covering maze invariants, movement feel, scoring and lives, ghost personalities and wave/fright/house/Elroy behavior, determinism, atlas determinism, scene parity across backends, protocol byte capture with transmit-once and fps-cap proofs, watchdog degradation, and CLI behavior.

## What is next

The interactive terminal loop with menus and audio, fruit and high scores with themes and extra modes; the Pages hub grows into instructions, controls, and the full performance scoreboard as those land. (`--render-bench` already prints per-backend throughput today.)

## Layout

- `pacman.py` - launcher (adds `src/` to the path, no install needed)
- `src/engine/` - pure simulation: `tuning`, `rng`, `maze`, `actors`, `ghosts`, `game`, `replay`
- `src/render/` - output backends: `protocol`, `framebuffer`, `ansi`, `unicode`, `kitty`, `sixel`, `detect`, `atlas`, `scene`, `manager`
- `src/shell/` - command line: `cli`
- `tests/` - pytest suite (`python3 -m pytest pacman/tests -q`)
- `docs/` - unified product documentation
